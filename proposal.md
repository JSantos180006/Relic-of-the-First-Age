## Description
Retro Type Text-Based and Turn Based Dungeon Crawler being an interactive narrative adventure. The adventure takes place in a fantasy medieval time where houses are lit using candles and people fight using swords and magic. The player finds an odd and metal dungeon which looks futuristic and Sci-Fi. These are ancient ruins that speak of a more advanced civilization that was once standing tall. It's relevant to media and digital arts because it is indeed an interactive narrative demonstrating the way code and story work together to make an engaging story.

## Features
- Interactive Narrative System
	-Using Python's Input Function, this will allow the player to add items to their inventory and make certain choices to progress the story.
- Turn-Based Combat
	-Using Loops and Condition Checks to ensure combat only begins when the player confronts an enemy. This allows both the player and enemies to take turn attacking, defending, or using items. 
- Progressive Dungeon Exploration
	- Will help reveal new segments of the story, encounters, and events that occur throughout the story. This will allow the player to progress through the story.
- Player Stats and Inventory System
	- Using Dictionaries, Lists, and classes to track health, items, and other states we may need to worry about.
-Level-Up and Stat Progression
	-After each battle the player gets experience points to level up the player stats and choose which stats to build up on.

## Challenges
- Learning to use Python's Dictionaries, List, and Classes as an RPG System to track and organize the stats and items.
- Researching how to implement a turn-based combat system that is both engaging and balanced.
- Learning how to make a progressive story system so the story only progresses when the player accomplishes a certain task or defeats a certain enemy.
- Researching and Designing a stat progrssion system for custom and balanced stat builds.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
-A Fully functional text based RPG with well balanced and interactive combat, a fun and interesting leveling system, and a very detailed description of of what is happening within every part of the story. I want every stat to have a special senario occur if they reach the max stat as well if possible. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
-A working text based adventure with an unbalanced but basic turn based combat system. Increasing the stats causes small things to occur like strength can allow the player to one-shot enemies or increasing luck to get better items. Leveling up is also very basic to increase stats.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1: Setup Python File with basic skeleton which include the player, combat, and story.
  2. Goal 2: Create Intro Scene displaying the Title and allowing the player to input their name and starting stat build as well as choosing the class they wish to play as from Warrior, Mage, and Cleric.

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1: Develop the turn-based combat system further with basic enemies and track health and experience points for leveling up. 
  2. Goal 2: Create Dungeon with multiple rooms and specific enemy types that also drops certain loots

- Week N (Final)
  1. Goal 1: Polish Dialogue ,descriptions, balance combat, balance stat increase, and balance the weapons and armors that drop from the enemies the player encounters
  2. Goal 2: Create the special stat senarios if player reaches max stat threshold and ensuring the game runs smoothly from start to finish.
